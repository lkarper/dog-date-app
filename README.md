# Dog Date

## Demo
[Live Demo](https://dog-date-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary
Dog Date is a web app for users who want to find playmates for their dogs. Whether you have one or one-hundred dogs, you can create profiles for them on Dog Date. You can set a profile picture for your dog, characterize its energy-levels, obedience, experience with other dogs, and more! This allows others to decide if your dog is the right playmate for their dog! Other users can leave reviews of your dog(s) and their dates, and then you can comment on those reviews in response.

## What can Dog Date do?

### Howl about your dog and see what others are howling about!
On Dog Date, you find playmates for your dog by [creating](https://dog-date-app.herokuapp.com/create-howl) and [viewing](https://dog-date-app.herokuapp.com/howls) "Howls".

Howls are essentially a message from a user that he or she is looking for playmates for his or her canine companion(s)! There are two types of Howls: "one-time" and "recurring" playdates. "One-time" playdates are requests for a playdate on a specific date. Users post a date, available time frames, and a proposed location, and then wait for other interested users to contact them. "Recurring" Howls, on the other hand, let users know that a user is generally available at certain times for a playdate (e.g. Saturdays from 11:00 am - 4:00 pm).

On the Howls page users can filter howls by zipcode, state, or the average rating of dogs in the Howl (more on ratings below.)

Note: At the moment, all of the Howls are demo requests and do not actually represent real-world dogs and users.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
